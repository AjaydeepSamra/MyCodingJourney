    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>Big, soft, gingerbread cookies made with molasses, ginger, and other spices are a holiday favorite. This gingerbread cookie recipe for ginger cookies rolled in sugar is sure to become household favorite.</p>
    <p>Enough about the cookies, lets get into what you need to make them!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar: 2 tablespoons white sugar, 1 cup white sugar. </strong>You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough, plus about two tablespoons of sugar for rolling the dough balls.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour. </strong>All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps create a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:2 teaspoons ground ginger, ½ teaspoon ground cloves, ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon. </strong>These soft gingerbread cookies are spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda: 1 teaspoon baking soda. </strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it makes the dough rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:¼ teaspoon salt. </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:¾ cup butter or margarine, softened. </strong>Butter is great for making perfectly soft ginger cookies with slightly crisp edges. If you'd like, you can substitute margarine.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:1 large egg. </strong>An egg adds moisture and acts as a binding agent (it holds the dough together). </li>
        <li><strong>Molasses: ¼ cup molasses. </strong>Molasses lends warm, cozy, and sweet flavor to these soft gingerbread cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon water.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that we know what we need, lets get into how to make them!</p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
         <li>Sift together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl.</li>
         <li>Beat butter and remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in molasses and water. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture until well combined.</li>
         <li>Use floured hands to shape dough into 24 walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in the reserved sugar until coated. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
         <li>Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
